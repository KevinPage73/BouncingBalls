# BouncingBalls
This is a modification of the BouncingBalls code example mad using p5js. 
The primary changes are the addition of a method of collision detection between balls themselves by comparing radius size, 
a fix to the problem of balls getting stuck inside of the walls, and the use of a background image file. 

This modification was made by Kevin Page, Computer Science student at Bucknell University.
